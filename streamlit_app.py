This app uses Deep learning (ResNet50) libraries namely keras to identify objects from images.

ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.
